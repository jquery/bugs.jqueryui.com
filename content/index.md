## This site is no longer in use

jQuery UI is in **maintenance-only mode**. Users should not expect any new releases. Patches may be issued to resolve critical security, interoperability, or regression bugs. See the [blog post](https://blog.jqueryui.com/2021/10/jquery-maintainers-update-and-transition-jquery-ui-as-part-of-overall-modernization-efforts/) for more information.

jQuery UI issues were moved to <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues">GitHub</a>. This site is now a static, read-only archive of the old <a href="https://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> site. Any critical issues should be filed on the project's <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues">GitHub repository</a>.

**Search** is still supported for tickets and milestones, but some functions and pages no longer work.

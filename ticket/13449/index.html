    <div class="ticket-description"><p>Certain websites, especially the kind which may mix various 3rd party plugins / modules / widgets on one page, such as websites running <a href="/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a> and similar CMSes, may end up with a mix of various <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> loading environments present on a single page.  For instance, one CMS plugin may load an AMD environment such as <a href="/wiki/RequireJS">RequireJS</a> via a &lt;script&gt; tag, and another plugin, unaware of the AMD-using plugin, may load jQuery and jQuery UI also via &lt;script&gt; tags.</p><p>The current implementation of jQuery UI core assumes that if an AMD environment is detected that means that jQuery is also available via AMD, and immediately attempts to load it via that method.  However, as described above, that is an incorrect assumption, and this logic will cause an error if jQuery is not actually available via AMD.</p><p>As demonstrated here:  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/wp9ebxbL/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/wp9ebxbL/</a></p><p>Make sure to open browser <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> console before clicking 'Run' to see the error from <a href="/wiki/RequireJS">RequireJS</a>.</p><p>jQuery UI needs to first check if jQuery is in fact available via AMD before trying to load it, and if not, then it should just revert to using jQuery in the global namespace.</p></div>

              <p>Replying to [comment:2 scott.gonzalez]:</p><blockquote> This is definitely not a common implementation. You should just create a shim that exposes jQuery via AMD. Having AMD support that mixes in global support doesn't make too much sense.</blockquote><p>I think you misunderstood me.  I'm not talking about deliberately creating such an implementation.</p><p>What I'm saying is that under certain circumstances, such an implementation can be unintentionally created when 2 unrelated bundles of code, one that uses jQuery / jQuery UI, and another that uses AMD may end up deployed together on the same website, with the developers of the original code having no control over how / where their work is deployed.</p><p>The example I provided in the description above is that this can happen on any <a href="/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a> site.  Specifically, the administrator of the <a href="/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a> site may install one plugin / theme that loads jQuery / jQuery UI globally, and then he might also install a completely unrelated plugin / theme that loads an AMD system such as <a href="/wiki/RequireJS">RequireJS</a>.</p><p>THE ORIGINAL PLUGIN / THEME DEVELOPERS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS DEPLOYMENT, BUT SUCH A PLUGIN / THEME COMBINATION WILL BREAK THE SITE.</p><p>The current implementation of jQuery UI makes it unsuitable for use in any plugin intended for plug-and-play 3rd party deployment, because under the conditions described above, the current jQuery UI logic in such a plugin will break the site.</p><p>I disagree with your statement that this is not a common implementation.  <a href="/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a> is a very popular CMS, and it is very common for <a href="/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a> administrators to mix multiple unrelated 3rd-party plugins / widgets on a single site.</p><p>I think that this problem should be considered a serious bug that needs to be fixed if jQuery UI is to be intended to be used safely in deployments outside the control of the original developers that integrated it into their work.</p>

Just encase the whole module into an anonymous function, and then pass that function the global variables corresponding to the new names (that you chose in your <a href="/wiki/RequireJS">RequireJS</a> tweak) of the default AMD functions.  The cool thing about this is that not only does it not require messing with the module internal logic, but this approach is completely transparent to the 'r.js' optimizer.  </p><p>Check out my build.js here: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maratbn/RainbowPayPress/2bd1f5f634074312ecd21939e29f747d947388c7/build.js" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maratbn/RainbowPayPress/2bd1f5f634074312ecd21939e29f747d947388c7/build.js</a></p><p>My build script: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maratbn/RainbowPayPress/2bd1f5f634074312ecd21939e29f747d947388c7/do_minify_le_requirejs" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maratbn/RainbowPayPress/2bd1f5f634074312ecd21939e29f747d947388c7/do_minify_le_requirejs</a></p>

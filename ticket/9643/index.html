              <blockquote> It's not random places, it's the overlay</blockquote><p>The overlay is literally the entire page besides the one part of the page that is deemed the only thing important (that's what modal means). So, yes, it is random places.</p><blockquote> Not providing it and just saying "it's easy, make it yourself" is an utterly ridiculous answer.</blockquote><p>Actually, it's policy for all jQuery projects. If 80% of users don't need it or it can be implemented easily, then there is no need for it to be implemented by the team.</p><blockquote> Why did you close the topic without even waiting for someone else's feedback on this?</blockquote><p>Because I don't need anyone else's feedback. I'm aware of current and past discussions about features for the past several years.</p><blockquote> Now nobody will see it and it will be forgotten just because you think your oppinion is the only one that matters.</blockquote><p>My opinion is that of the team. Everyone that needs to see it will see it, regardless of the status. Do you think the team has never thought about this functionality before?</p>

              <blockquote> Why make users come up with various hacks instead of implementing it in a proper way if it takes less than 10 lines of code to do it?</blockquote><p>Because 10 lines times 20 features = 200 lines. It also means 20 more options to document, making it near impossible to learn how to use the widget properly. It also means thousands of configuration combinations that need to work together. Implementation size for a feature is just one of many considerations.</p><p>Also, let's be very clear that we're not making users come up with various hacks. This is super straight forward to implement, and it's extremely easy for anyone to create a plugin which adds the option and put it on our hosted plugins site.</p>

You have to read the full documentation to learn how to use something properly. Just look at the mess that is <code>jQuery.ajax()</code>. There are tons of options. Nobody uses all of them. Tons of people get confused by the sheer insanity of the API. We have the same problem with the current draggable API.</p><blockquote> If so, could you please make that plugin for me?</blockquote><p>No. I think it's a terrible idea.

              <p>Right... Well, anyway, I really don't see the reason why something so simple as this mod wouldn't be committed; one example of its usage would be for popups that simply display some content without interaction (i.e. no buttons or forms inside the popup, just data). I also don't see how this would conflict with anything else because this would only work if modal option is enabled, which narrows its "area of effect" quite a lot.</p>

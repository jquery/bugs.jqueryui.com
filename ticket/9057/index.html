&gt; &gt; I also ran into this problem but i needed the draggable stuff to scroll when over flow was hidden so I extended the scrollParent function and that is when I found the IE issue.&#92;

&gt; &#92;
&gt; overflow:hidden is not allowed to have scroll bar, so it&#39;s not scroll parent. I&#39;m inclined to advise you to change the height dynamically.&#92;
&#92;
It wasn&#39;t the height I needed but the width and changing the width did not fit my needs for the project I was working on. I don&#39;t want a scroll bar but the scroll-ability. I couldn&#39;t get the desired effect with changing the width. I you have a better idea I&#39;d love to hear it.&#92;

This is what I was doing when I found this IE issue that this topic is about (still in development)&#92;

Also if I didn't extend the the scroll parent to use hidden the it would only work if it had a scroll bar, and in everything but IE. Removing the if statement in the scroll parent function where it test for IE and just used the part in the else fixed it in IE 9.

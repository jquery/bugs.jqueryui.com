              <p>Technically this isn't a bug. The "leak" goes away if you destroy the tooltip. If the content is so large that it's causing major memory problems for you, perhaps you should reconsider whether the content you're displaying is actually a tooltip.</p>

&#92;
How is this not a bug? What is the purpose of having a copy of the entire contents of the tooltip in the DOM until the tooltip is destroyed? In a web app that is built to stay open for a very long time, the useless divs pile up to absurd quantities. Now, if there&#39;s a particular purpose for this behavior, then I&#39;d love to hear what it is.&#92;
&#92;
We have a tooltip that&#39;s a table with some information, styled. We have tooltips like that scattered all over the page. Each time a tooltip is hovered, even if just for split second, causes a complete copy of that table to be inserted into the DOM. Over time, this can build up to silly memory usage.&#92;
&#92;
But yeah. Can you explain what the purpose of this behavior is? It was introduced in a recent version of jQuery UI (I suspect 1.11) and it&#39;s big enough for me to have to regress to a previous version.&#92;
&#92;
Kind regards,&#92;

              <p>Thank you for your answers. They are much appreciated. I understand the reasoning behind this design now (and I feel your pain for having to do it this way), but the fact remains that this implementation is less than desirable. It's not the expected behavior for end users and it's not documented outside the source code.</p><p>This behavior is also applied to delegated tooltips, which makes the problem worse, because delegated tooltips are rarely destroyed. There has also never been a reason to do so. I've taken the liberty to look at some code on other websites I've worked on and see the same problem. Pages that don't reload (particularly web apps) create quite big memory leaks all around. This problem did not occur in older versions of jQuery UI. It's bad enough that we'd rather regress to an older version to prevent this issue... and we'd really like to keep all our projects up to date with the latest versions of jQuery / jQuery UI.</p><p>I do understand that accessibility is important, but in all the cases I've observed in our personal projects, it didn't matter. None of these tooltips are meant to be read aloud. They are however meant to be shown incredibly often on a page that doesn't reload. Gaining accessibility in favor of a memory leak seems like a bad tradeoff. Perhaps we could look for a way to allow for both? Maybe through an option?</p><p>I really hope this issue can be addressed in future updates. I also hope we can both agree that this behavior is less than desirable at least. Marking it as "not a bug" is one thing, but maybe it could still be marked as "bad side-effect"?</p>

              <p>Replying to [comment:4 <a href="/wiki/DysprosiumDy">DysprosiumDy</a>]:</p><blockquote> Thank you for your answers. They are much appreciated. I understand the reasoning behind this design now (and I feel your pain for having to do it this way), but the fact remains that this implementation is less than desirable. It's not the expected behavior for end users and it's not documented outside the source code.</blockquote><p>Yeah, it's really unfortunate that accessibility usually comes at the cost of hacks and mangled code.</p><blockquote> I do understand that accessibility is important, but in all the cases I've observed in our personal projects, it didn't matter. None of these tooltips are meant to be read aloud. They are however meant to be shown incredibly often on a page that doesn't reload. Gaining accessibility in favor of a memory leak seems like a bad tradeoff. Perhaps we could look for a way to allow for both? Maybe through an option?</blockquote><p>We will never add an option to disable accessibility. Perhaps we can dynamically create and destroy the entire live region based on a timer after all tooltips are closed.</p><blockquote> I really hope this issue can be addressed in future updates. I also hope we can both agree that this behavior is less than desirable at least. Marking it as "not a bug" is one thing, but maybe it could still be marked as "bad side-effect"?</blockquote><p>I'll re-open to see if the dynamic creation will work. Hopefully completely removing the element will address the JAWS problem.</p>

              <p>I've seen this too.  It's quite painful:</p><p>I have a dense menu with a lot of controls - each with a tooltip, and if you move the mouse over </p><p>the menu, tooltips go up and down quite frequently, causing a lot of these hidden divs to be created.</p><p>I work in accessibility, so I'm not against it :-)  But this behavior really isn't helpful in the </p><p>sense that one mouse movement is giving a log that has the same data repeated 10s of times.</p><p>Suggestion: Set a timer and only make a log entry when a tooltip stays up for some reasonable </p><p>minimum time - say a second or two.  That would keep the log, but reduce the noise.  (Note that </p><p>virtual mice can move more slowly than real ones.)</p><p>Suggestion: Number the log entries.  If making an entry that is within a reasonable window of </p><p>another copy of the same text, enter something like "Dup of <a href="/ticket/10">#10</a>" instead.</p><p>In both cases, note that bandwidth to the user is also a precious resource - voice and Braille are both</p><p>slower than optical reading.  So avoiding thrash and collapsing duplicates is a good thing.</p>

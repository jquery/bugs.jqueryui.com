              <p>I'm confused about how this would help. Wouldn't your increase and decrease methods fail if the next step isn't in your custom list? If I'm misunderstanding, could you provide a reduced example of what you're trying to accomplish and how the spin event would help? Thanks.</p>

              <p>This seems like a pretty big abuse of what spinner does; you should probably be using a select. If you really want to use a spinner, then just move all the spin logic into a separate function and call that from your buttons.</p>

              <p>I already have done so with a separate function. I can't agree with your choice of words though. It isn't an "abuse". Even if we accepted for a moment that it was, it certainly is not a "pretty big" one.</p><p>If I had a &lt;select&gt; with hundreds of predefined numeric values instead, THAT would be "a pretty big abuse" (of end-user's brain and page's UI). Spinner is exactly what is logical in this case: it operates with integers only, the value can be changed in fine increments or really fast (by pressing holding the up/down button), there is no need to scroll some huge list of numbers, the control is self-explanatory: the up/down buttons indicate that the value increases or decreases and finally it just looks neater. Can you really imagine a &lt;select&gt; with a hundred of numeric values? This would look like something from 1994.</p><p>I was rather hoping that this discussion would come to another logical conclusion: we would agree to introduce new spinner option that will allow to specify a list of all possible values as an array. Seems our logic differs here too. If this as an "abuse" then I guess I should not even attempt raising a feature request...</p>

              <p>BTW, going back to the original issue, I still fail to see how not raising the spin event when using the step/page methods is justified.

              <p>Thank you, I will take a look at the 'incremental' option. Would it really be a lesser abuse if I changed it there? I think neither is an abuse (or both of them are -- depends how you look at it). What I would say, nevertheless, is that abuse starts where flexibility and extensibility ends (so how about that new option then? ;-) )</p><p>And on the other topic, if programmatic steps were possible to prevent, this would be bad... how?

              <p>Fair enough. I fully agree with the last point about adding options as a last resort but only when the first part ("plenty of extension points" is true). Let's see.</p><p>There are in total 3 possible "entry points" where the logic could be changed: the 'spin' event, the 'start' event and the 'incremental' option - those are the only possibilities to trigger user function that could be used to manipulate the widget before it gets new value assigned.</p><p>I tried to use the suggested 'incremental' spinner option but failed to find a way to make it work (I'd like to be corrected) and here is why. When that 'incremental' event is fired its handler gets passed nothing but a 'number of spins' which is an absolute value. Without any reference to the event that originated spinning it is impossible to see which direction the spinning is going to go (because the spinner's new value has not been calculated yet). No luck here.</p><p>Unlike the 'incremental' option, the 'spin' event does offer you an object where the newly obtained but not yet assigned spinner value is ready and available (and all of that is nicely documented too). You can see which way the spinning is going and you can easily manipulate the final value. This way of doing things has been deemed abusive so we also discount it.</p><p>That leaves us with the 'start' event which does not offer the newly computed value so getting the spinning direction is harder (you need to check which button started the event). In addition, just like the 'spin' event, it does not fire when stepUp()/Down() methods are used. Therefore it is in no way better than the 'spin' event, in fact it is worse.</p><p>So, talking about "multiple ways of doing what I want". Not really. It seems there isn't any other way except what's already been suggested above: pointing 'spin' event to my own custom function that will mangle the values and then calling the same function instead of the built-in stepUp()/stepDown() methods. I would like to be corrected but while it may look like "spinner has plenty of extension points" the only possible way to achieve what I want is deemed abusive and there is no other way no matter how you spin it (pun intended).</p><p>Now I have also established that neither 'spin' nor 'start/stop' events fire when programmatic steps are used and yet, there is still no clarity on the main topic of this ticket: WHY is it bad to be able to prevent programmatic steps?</p>

Both slider and spinner should trigger the respective slider and spin events when changing the value programmatically. I don't see why programmatic events shouldn't be cancellable. It may seem like it encourages spreading user code across various places, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.</p>

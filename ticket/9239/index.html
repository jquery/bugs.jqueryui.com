My specific one was performing some checks on the hovered element to display the tooltip only when the said element is overflowing horizontally, [http://stackoverflow.com/q/16138869/1331430 SO thread here].&#92;
&#92;
I believe the correct way to implement such functionality would be providing an option such as a `filter` callback which is called as soon as a hovered/focused item triggers the tooltip, and its return value should be a boolean indicating whether the tooltip should be displayed. Though, this would most likely take a lot more of effort to implement, let alone depending on the implementation it&#39;d mix jQuery UI tooltips with native title tooltips which would be unwanted.&#92;
&#92;
Hence if I can cleanly get the reference to the hovered element inside an `tooltipopen` handler to perform some checks on element and call `ui.tooltip.hide()` depending on the condition should suffice - this way the native tooltip is not displayed and the live cycle of the UI tooltip is preserved, though it has `display:none` all along its live cycle.&#92;
&#92;
Here&#39;s a test case with a relatively more clean way of doing the requested feature:&#92;

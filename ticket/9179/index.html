&gt; Hi greg.wacker,&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the jQuery UI project.  This was an intentional change made in 1.10 (http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#removed-support-for-non-number-falsey-values-for-active-option).  You can use a number to accomplish this: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/EYCv2/.&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&#92;
Thank you for the quick response and example.&#92;
&#92;
That&#39;s an unfortunate change to me. I can no longer use a scripting language to dynamically alter classes to determine which panel opens on page load. I now have to break my JavaScript out of a .js file (minified) at some level and instead write dynamic inline JavaScript depending on a user action, which is something I typically try to avoid.&#92;
&#92;
I understand the urge to simplify the UI code base and it&#39;s all about where that line is drawn for library performance/size vs features, but I also wanted to point out why some people might find this option pretty useful.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1364247316207910</span>

edit: I take last part back to an extent... I guess I can come up with the index based on my active class name in my static .js file just as you had before.

This was an intentional change made in 1.10 (<a href="http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#removed-support-for-non-number-falsey-values-for-active-option)." class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#removed-support-for-non-number-falsey-values-for-active-option).</a>  You can use a number to accomplish this: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/EYCv2/." class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/EYCv2/.</a> </blockquote><p>Thank you for the quick response and example.</p><p>That's an unfortunate change to me. I can no longer use a scripting language to dynamically alter classes to determine which panel opens on page load. I now have to break my <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> out of a .js file (minified) at some level and instead write dynamic inline <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> depending on a user action, which is something I typically try to avoid.</p><p>I understand the urge to simplify the UI code base and it's all about where that line is drawn for library performance/size vs features, but I also wanted to point out why some people might find this option pretty useful.</p><p>edit: I take last part back to an extent... I guess I can come up with the index based on my active class name in my static .js file just as you had before. More code, but I'm guessing it's not a often used method to warrant adding to the library.</p><p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Wyt4Z/2/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/Wyt4Z/2/</a></p>

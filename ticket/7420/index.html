Mac's Spotlight exhibits behaviour in line with my above assumption</blockquote><p>Actually, it's impossible to blur spotlight. You could easily build spotlight with jQuery UI by clearing the internal previous value on close.</p><blockquote>   2. Safari's Google search field exhibits behaviour in line with my above assumption</blockquote><p>Safari's search field is arguably worse than jQuery UI. Type "ja", then press backspace and watch all results disappear.</p><blockquote>   3. Google's Instant search exhibits behaviour in line with my above assumption</blockquote><p>Google's instant search is completely separate from their autocomplete, they just happen to run simultaneously. I assume you want to discuss the actual autocomplete behavior since Google would obviously not blank out the page during instant search. Go to Google, type "ja" to turn on instant search, copy the value, press escape (to close the autocomplete), tab out, tab back, paste and watch as absolutely nothing happens. If you retype "ja" you'll get results, but again, that's instant - we do the exact same thing if you turn off delay and make the jQuery UI autocomplete instant. You'll also notice that if you type "j", blur the field, refocus the field and type "j" again, nothing will happen. </p>

A user types in "ja", the results are shown. &gt;   2. He/she blurs the field. &gt;   3. Say the user wants to see the same autocomplete results again. Then he would type in "ja" again right?  Or press the down arrow.</blockquote><p>I'm sorry but this is a rather curt, odd and unexpected response. </p><p>Clearly we aren't here to dictate what user should and shouldn't do depending on an implementation detail in the code.</p><blockquote>  &gt;   4. However the end result since "ja" typed now is the same as the "ja" entered previously is that the '''previous results aren't re-displayed''' - to reiterate, it appears to the user that nothing happens.  There are multiple solutions here: turn off delay, press the down arrow (which requires less effort), customize autocomplete to clear its internal previous value on blur.</blockquote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. Clearly turning off the delay is not a clever solution, since it hammers the server, as you point out above.</p><p>I will of course now attempt to customise the autocomplete so that it simply re-displays its last results if a user retypes the same query. </p><p>I will try to ensure that jquery does not actually destroy the previous results, but simply hides them, in case the results need to be re-shown.</p><blockquote>  Replying to [comment:3 ebunton]: &gt; Let's take real-world examples of my assumption above: &gt;  &gt;   1. Mac's Spotlight exhibits behaviour in line with my above assumption  Actually, it's impossible to blur spotlight. You could easily build spotlight with jQuery UI by clearing the internal previous value on close.</blockquote><p>Yes, it is impossible to blur spotlight. </p><p>That is clearly not my point.</p><blockquote>  &gt;   2. Safari's Google search field exhibits behaviour in line with my above assumption  Safari's search field is arguably worse than jQuery UI. Type "ja", then press backspace and watch all results disappear.</blockquote><p>Yes, the backspace behaviour is a poorer implementation.</p><p> Again this is not my point. It would be great if you could stay within the bounds of the discussion.</p><blockquote>  &gt;   3. Google's Instant search exhibits behaviour in line with my above assumption  Google's instant search is completely separate from their autocomplete, they just happen to run simultaneously. I assume you want to discuss the actual autocomplete behavior since Google would obviously not blank out the page during instant search. Go to Google, type "ja" to turn on instant search, copy the value, press escape (to close the autocomplete), tab out, tab back, paste and watch as absolutely nothing happens. </blockquote><p>Which is still acceptable since google keeps the "ja" results displayed.</p><blockquote> If you retype "ja" you'll get results, but again, that's instant - we do the exact same thing if you turn off delay and make the jQuery UI autocomplete instant. You'll also notice that if you type "j", blur the field, refocus the field and type "j" again, nothing will happen. </blockquote><p>I find your argument rather weak since Google's implementation is bolstered by their Instant Search. They always show results (autocomplete or otherwise) when there is a match.</p><p>Arguably, the last point you make about typing "j", blurring, and then typing "j" again in google is a bug as this is plainly inconsistent behaviour. However it doesn't appear like a bug since google keeps its results on screen for that "j" query (pardon the pun).</p><p>All in all, I'm a disappointed by your seemingly snarky comments to what I think is a very reasonable expectation (something which you have not expressed an opinion... perhaps deliberately?).</p><p>Thanks anyway for your time in responding.</p>

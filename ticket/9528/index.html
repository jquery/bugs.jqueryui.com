I know that option, but what if you don’t want to show 2 full months?&#92;
&#92;
And why wouldn&#39;t date picker act the same way as the MS clock calendar works? When you click a date in another month, the hole calendar shifts to that month. &#92;
&#92;
Maby I should rephrase my report: I think the current interaction with prev/next isn&#39;t optimal and could be improved. As told above there are several options.&#92;

&#92;
I think it should show at least one or two weeks ahead of current date. When that passes the current month, there should be added an additional row with an extra weeks.&#92;
&#92;
The current Date picker is based on “months”. There are cases where ‘months’ isn’t the main interval but for example it could be ‘weeks’. &#92;
Forexample our case, we use OTRS (ticketing system),  when we called a customer we set that ticket to ‘pending’ for one week. The current jQuery date picker interface doesn’t really provide this. And at the end of the month we get annoyed buy always needing to click the ‘next’ button. The rest of the month, this isn’t a problem since in 1 click we have the full month.&#92;
Basically what I wonder is Why can’t it just show 2 weeks ahead? why does it always need to be a full month interval?&#92;
Thanks for the feedback. These are just some thoughts of a lost user :)&#92;

At the end of the month we need to clicks instead of one, this can be fixed and maby should!&#92;

There are cases where ‘months’ isn’t the main interval but for example it could be ‘weeks’. </p><p>Forexample our case, we use OTRS (ticketing system),  when we called a customer we set that ticket to ‘pending’ for one week. The current jQuery date picker interface doesn’t really provide this. And at the end of the month we get annoyed buy always needing to click the ‘next’ button. The rest of the month, this isn’t a problem since in 1 click we have the full month.</p><p>Basically what I wonder is Why can’t it just show 2 weeks ahead? why does it always need to be a full month interval?</p><p>At the end of the month we need to clicks instead of one, this can be fixed and maybe should!</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. These are just some thoughts of a lost user :)</p>

              <p>Because that's how calendars work? I'm not really inclined to add support for a feature that is pretty rare. Feel free to investigate what would need to be done in the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/datepicker" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>rewrite</a> to make it possible for you to implement this as an extension.</p>

              <p>So it takes you exactly the same number of clicks as using the existing navigation. Again, I don't think we'll be implementing this, but look into what it would take to make an extension.</p>

              <p>I added a svn diff for this. Not sure if thats the way to contribute with patches.</p><p>Anyway. The diff makes the following possible:</p><p>$('#foo').dialog({</p><p>    'buttons' : {</p><p>        'primary' : {</p><p>            id:'fooButton',</p><p>            priority: 'primary',</p><p>            click: function() {</p><p>                ...</p><p>            },</p><p>        },</p><p>        'secondary' : {</p><p>            click: function() {</p><p>               ...</p><p>            },</p><p>            priority: 'secondary'</p><p>        },</p><p>        'disabled' : {</p><p>            disabled: true</p><p>        }</p><p>    }</p><p>});</p><p>Im kind of a beginner at unit tests, I have checked the tests for dialog and I think I can manage to make tests for these changes BUT I wan't someone to review the patch to check if it's OK first and I also like the following to be discussed:</p><ul><li>I realize the click callback is now optional. Is that OK?</li></ul><ul><li>If no id is set, the default '' will be used and the DOM will look like &lt;button id="" ...&gt;..&lt;/button&gt; Is that OK? I think it's ugly but doing $('&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;').attr('id', options.id).prependTo(..) is so much nicer than var $button = $('&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;'); if(options.id !== '') { $button.attr('id', options.id) } $button.prependTo(..)</li></ul><p>Differences between ui.dialog.diff and ui.dialog.diff.2</p><p>The first patch makes it possible to add custom css classes</p><p>$('#foo').dialog({</p><p>    'buttons' : {</p><p>        'cancel' : {</p><p>            priority: 'secondary',</p><p>            classes: 'foo bar baz',</p><p>            click: function() {</p><p>                ...</p><p>            },</p><p>        },</p><p>    }</p><p>});</p><p>Adding custom classes skips the ui-corner-all class. Example of usage: someone want's to make a cancel button look like a link instead of a rounded corner button. Though secondary priority and custom classes could be combined. Another example of usage is if someone would like only some of the corners rounded. The ui-corner-all class could be added with custom classes if needed.</p><p>The second patch takes another approach. Instead of allowing custom classes it takes advantage of the fact that you can put any string into priority. This applies to first patch aswell though.</p><p>Example:</p><p>$('#foo').dialog({</p><p>    'buttons' : {</p><p>        'foobar' : {</p><p>            priority: 'custom-prio',</p><p>            click: function() {</p><p>                ...</p><p>            },</p><p>        },</p><p>    }</p><p>});</p><p>The button will then get a class of 'ui-priority-custom-prio'. To disable rounded corners with this patch one could use cornerAll: false </p><p>$('#foo').dialog({</p><p>    'buttons' : {</p><p>        'foobar' : {</p><p>            priority: 'custom-prio',</p><p>            cornerAll: false,</p><p>            click: function() {</p><p>                ...</p><p>            },</p><p>        },</p><p>    }</p><p>});</p><p>Im not sure either of this making it possible to customize the buttons is something wanted. It's probably very rare use-cases. I mean, either you use the jquery ui css framework or don't, not half of it.</p><p>Please discuss this and ideas and let me now how I can improve the patch. </p>

You shouldn't need to rewrite the logic of your code just to be able to do such things. And personally, I feel it's simpler to have static named labels, as it reduces the cognitive load to identify structures; True, I havn't don't any survey how it is out in the world regarding if current system, or my proposed system is best/easiest to use, so I have only my rather technical-wired mind to work with :).</p>

              <p>I think a good first step to improving the API is to create a new button instance and extend the button widget's options for each button.  The API might change sightly, but would give you immediate access to all current (and future) options, and then some.  It wouldn't be too difficult to retain backwards compatibility.</p><p>An API like this makes sense to me:</p><pre class="wiki">
buttons: {
	"OK": {
		disabled: true, // available by extending the button widget
		icons: {}, // available by extending the button widget
		priority: 1,
		id: "ok-button",
		handler: function(){
			// do something on click
		}
	}
}
</pre><p>If you really wanted to interact with the buttons after initialization, let the button widget do the heavy lifting.</p><pre class="wiki">
$("#button-ok").button("disable");

// or if you must, some kind of getter
$("#dialog").dialog("buttons", "button-ok").button("disable");
</pre><p>Allowing people to add and remove buttons after initialization seems like an edge case to me.  Create all the buttons and either disable/enable/hide/show them based on actions taken inside the dialog.</p>

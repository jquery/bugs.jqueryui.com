&#92;
At [http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#event-create] it still says you can use the create event while you obviously can not. What makes this even worse is the fact that the beforeShow event does not fire either when using the datepicker inline which leaves you with nothing to hook into before the datepicker is shown.

Both the datepicker and the documentation system are being entirely rewritten, which will solve the issue from both sides. In the meantime, I&#39;ve created a custom template just for datepicker that leaves out the create event (as it is not implemented, and likely won&#39;t be until rewritten to use the widget factory) and also added a note in its place saying it&#39;s a known issue that the create event is not triggered. This change is live at http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker#events and will be live on http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker#events when the next stable release goes up.&#92;
&#92;
&gt; What makes this even worse is the fact that the beforeShow event does not fire either when using the datepicker inline&#92;
&#92;
beforeShow doesn&#39;t make any sense for an inline datepicker because it&#39;s always visible. Hence, there is no point before which it is shown. So this is by design.&#92;
&#92;
Anyway, here&#39;s a workaround for the missing create event:&#92;
{{{&#92;
// Workaround for missing datepickercreate event&#92;
(function( $ ) {&#92;
  var $fndatepicker = $.fn.datepicker;&#92;
  $.fn.datepicker = function( options ) {&#92;
    $( this ).trigger( &quot;datepickercreate&quot; );&#92;
    options &amp;&amp; options.create &amp;&amp; options.create();&#92;
    return $fndatepicker.apply( this, arguments );&#92;
  };&#92;
})( jQuery );&#92;

              <p>Nice to hear that the documentation issue is being addressed. And thank you for the create event workaround. It might come in handy for someone sometime. Unfortunately it turned out that, with or without the create event, I can't prevent the datepicker from setting the current date active when no other is selected. </p><p></p><hr><p></p><blockquote> beforeShow doesn't make any sense for an inline datepicker because it's always visible.

There's some documentation on <a href="http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>this wiki page</a>, although it's a bit out of date.</p><p>Probably the easiest thing to do is checkout out the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/datepicker" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>datepicker branch</a> to see where it's at.</p><p>There's plenty to do and we would love to have help on the rewrite.

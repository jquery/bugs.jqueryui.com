Whenever you try to click on a suggestion and the main autocomplete input field doesn&#39;t have focus then it does focus on this input field instead of selecting a value. When the field is already focused it works ok.&#92;
&#92;
input can be not focused when you try to trigger autocomplete suggestions manually by calling &#92;
&#92;
autoComplete.autocomplete(&quot;search&quot;);&#92;
&#92;
https://jsfiddle.net/Lm7xqs37/3/&#92;
&#92;
How to reproduce a bug: &#92;
&#92;
1. Do not make a focus on input&#92;
2. Click &quot;Search&quot; button&#92;
3. Select the very last position from suggestion. If you have very big screen try to use CTRL + to make it bigger so the input field is outside of the window area&#92;
&#92;
Works ok with 1.11.4&#92;
&#92;
For now I&#39;m fixing it just by restoring a focus after a click &#92;
&#92;
Replace $( &quot;#tags&quot; ).autocomplete(&quot;search&quot;);&#92;
with    $( &quot;#tags&quot; ).autocomplete(&quot;search&quot;).focus();&#92;
&#92;
and it works again&#92;

Whenever you &#92;
- try to click on a suggestion &#92;
- and the main autocomplete input field doesn&#39;t have focus &#92;
- and the main autocomplete input field is outside of window area&#92;
then it does focus on this input field instead of selecting a value. When the field is already focused it works ok.&#92;
&#92;
input can be not focused when you try to trigger autocomplete suggestions manually by calling &#92;
&#92;
autoComplete.autocomplete(&quot;search&quot;);&#92;
&#92;

&#92;
How to reproduce a bug: &#92;
&#92;
1. Do not make a focus on input&#92;
2. Click &quot;Search&quot; button&#92;
3. Select the very last position from suggestion. If you have very big screen try to use CTRL + to make it bigger so the input field is outside of the window area&#92;
&#92;
Works ok with 1.11.4&#92;
&#92;
For now I&#39;m fixing it just by restoring a focus after a click &#92;
&#92;
Replace $( &quot;#tags&quot; ).autocomplete(&quot;search&quot;);&#92;
with    $( &quot;#tags&quot; ).autocomplete(&quot;search&quot;).focus();&#92;
&#92;
and it works again&#92;

My last bug report was a duplication. Sorry about that. &#92;
I couldn&#39;t find bug related with this as well, so sorry if this is another duplication.&#92;

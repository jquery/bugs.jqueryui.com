    <div class="ticket-description"><p>The current implementation of <a href="/ticket/8730">#8730</a> can cause unwanted scrolling when closing a dialog.</p><p>The culprit is here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/14691ae#diff-bd5d7db0e6a3ff783a7ec2ccf261f6b4R251" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/14691ae#diff-bd5d7db0e6a3ff783a7ec2ccf261f6b4R251</a></p><p>The problem is that this implementation assumes that the dialog was opened via a user interaction with a <code>:focusable</code> element ("<code>this.opener</code>" in the code--a not entirely accurate name), which is not always the case.  Even when it is, the element may not be in view.  If the originally-focused element is not in view at the time of closing the dialog, this call to <code>.focus()</code> will result in it being unexpectedly scrolled into view.  This produces a jarring effect for the user.</p><p>Example of this behavior:  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jzxseunh/1/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/jzxseunh/1/</a></p><p>A real use case:</p><p>I have set up a shortcut key that opens a dialog for taking a screenshot of the current viewport.  Clicking "OK" in the dialog closes it and triggers the screenshot.  There is an element somewhere at the top of the page that has the focus.  I scroll down to a section of the page where the focused element is not in view and trigger the screenshot, but it will only capture the top of the page since the focus was restored and the page was scrolled before the screenshot was executed.</p><p>There are several other typical and valid use cases, and perhaps also some hacky workarounds, but the bottom line is that closing a dialog should probably not ever trigger scrolling.</p><p>Maybe, instead of calling <code>.focus()</code> inside the above-referenced <code>if</code> condition, the focusing step could be wrapped in a save/restore of the scroll position of <code>this.opener.scrollParent()</code>? (An optimization could do make this happen conditionally, based on whether or not the element was already visible inside its scrollparent and the viewport).</p><p>Does this sound reasonable? Thoughts?</p></div>

              <p>This is an interesting one. I understand your use case (and think it's valid), but I'm not sure it's common enough to be accounted for in the widget itself. Especially because I can think of cases where you do want to scroll on close.</p><p>For your purposes you can change your code sample into a quick dialog extension:</p><pre class="wiki">
$.widget( "ui.dialog", $.ui.dialog, {
    close: function( event ) {
        var openerScrollParent = this.opener.scrollParent(),
            scrollTop = openerScrollParent.scrollTop(),
            scrollLeft = openerScrollParent.scrollLeft();

        this._super( event );
        
        openerScrollParent.scrollTop( scrollTop ).scrollLeft( scrollLeft );        
    }

Suggestions on how the widget could be more extensible are also welcome.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the response. The use case I gave is just one of many other valid ones I can think of. For example, if you've scrolled a page and then try to close the tab or window (accidentally or on purpose), a dialog could open to ask if you really want to leave the page. Clicking "no" in this case would scroll the page and lose your place.</p><p>There are many such use cases, the general theme being "the user scrolls the active element out of the viewport, a dialog is triggered without the user's interaction with the active element or any other <code>:focusable</code> element, said dialog is closed, the document scrolls 'by itself', the user is confused." Though I actually can't think of a case where you'd want closing a dialog to change the scroll position of the page, especially as default behavior.</p><p>Restoring the ''focus'' is fine and correct, but the scrolling is, in my opinion, an occasional side effect of this browser a11y logic whose possibility was overlooked in the initial feature implementation.</p><p>In any case, my opinion is that the widget should be the one that ''does'' allow the scroll, and that the default behavior should restore both the focus AND the scroll position, if needed. Other opinions are definitely welcome! Thanks again.</p>

              <p>I think it would be disorienting to a user to have focus placed in a field that is not visible. For instance the user may try to use the arrow keys to move around the page and be confused why their key presses are not working. Browsers scroll to focused fields for a reason and I think we should respect that behavior, at least by default.</p>

              <p>Browsers scroll to newly-focused elements (not just form fields) for a11y reasons, but I'm not convinced these reasons apply to the case we have here, where we're just trying to restore pre-dialog state. Official a11y folks can weigh in here.</p><p>In your example, if the user scrolls a focused form field out of view (only done via mouse/touch or Page Up/Down) and begins to type, the browser will scroll the field back into view. This is default browser behavior. My suggestion won't change this, but it will actually fix the cases where the user wants to continue using the mouse/page keys to scroll from where they left off.</p>

&#92;
I&#39;m not sure the prior discussion ever reached a proper conclusion, so would it be possible to reopen the ticket?&#92;
&#92;
The open, essential question for me is whether or not we want the focus-restoring behavior of closing a jQuery UI Dialog to be, by default, closer in line with the standard behavior of closing a JS alert/confirm/prompt dialog (i.e. pre-dialog focus is restored, without scrolling). My opinion is that yes, it should.&#92;
&#92;
I&#39;m not yet convinced that the use case given by tj.vantoll is a valid counter-argument to the ones I provided. In the specific case TJ cites, any user interaction with the page after the dialog is closed is identical to what would have happened if no dialog had opened in the first place. To me (and I hope not just to me), this is correct behavior.&#92;
&#92;
It would be great if anyone else on the jQuery UI team or even from the community had a chance to provide feedback on this issue, so it&#39;s not just two voices re-stating our opinions. :] Thanks!</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1445123074789053</span>

              <p>Thanks for the elaboration, scott.gonzalez. I wasn't aware that any other team member had expressed an opinion on this (there is only feedback from one on this ticket), so perhaps I should've used another forum to make the issue more visible and to get more explicit feedback on it.</p><p>Since the focus-restoring behavior this ticket seeks to correct is not limited to jQuery UI's Dialog implementation, I will seek feedback elsewhere and see if other a11y experts or folks from the greater web standards/development community can chime in. It seems like it may be <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/94" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>a hole in a standard</a> or some guidelines somewhere (maybe <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-update-steps" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>here</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>here</a>?)...</p><p>If I learn something interesting or useful, I'll update here for posterity if that's OK.</p>

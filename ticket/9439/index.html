The console error only pops up in firefox. There are other issues in Chrome and Chromium, however that is a different matter.</p><p>The dialog settings need to include to replicate:</p><pre class="wiki">
{
    modal: true,
    draggable: true,
    appendTo: myIframe.contentWindow.document.body
}
</pre><p>When you try to drag the dialog box, the error pops up in the console.</p><p><strong>The code</strong></p><p>There is a selection in the _createOverlay function that takes no care to ensure scope safety or to make a relative DOM query.</p><p>It looks like this</p><pre class="wiki">
$(".ui-dialog:visible:last .ui-dialog-content")
</pre><p>Since $ is not in the same scope as the dialog, the context needs to be passed into the query. Like this</p><pre class="wiki">
var elementContext = that.element[0].ownerDocument;
$(".ui-dialog:visible:last .ui-dialog-content", elementContext)
</pre><p>The error in the firefox console is:</p><p><strong>TypeError: $(...).data(...) is null</strong></p><p>I have created a patch in my jquery ui fork.</p></div>

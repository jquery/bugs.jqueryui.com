&gt; &gt; I really don&#39;t think we should handle this. The problem in every one of these cases is that there&#39;s no common ancestor. &#92;

&#92;
We intentionally don&#39;t handle this, not because no one will ever have this markup, but because if someone does, they know better how to deal with it than we do. The only we could do it is choose one of several possible combinations of moving both elements and wrapping one or more of them. That might seriously break someone&#39;s form if they&#39;re not expecting it, or they might want it done a different way, and we can only choose 1, whereas they can choose many. So, for this reason we don&#39;t feel the fix should be built-in. If such a fix is needed, it needs to be done by the user before calling this widget.&#92;

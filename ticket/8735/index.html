              <p>Here's my working scenario:</p><p>When a tab is shown, I perform methods to assemble the content of that tab.  So if the activate event doesn't fire for the first tab, nothing is shown for that tab.  Nor is it possible to force an activate event because the 0th tab is already active. This doesn't seem like a rare use case and I'm having trouble thinking of a use case where a user would prefer the activate event didn't occur for the tab that is active by default.</p>

              <p>This ticket should be reopened and this should be fixed because this design is seriously flawed. The answer to the question "Please explain why you can't use the create event." is this: Because I don't want to use different event to do THE SAME THINGS only because it's first tab. This is ridiculous to make me use create() event to handle something specifically for the FIRST tab and use activate() event for all other tabs. First tab is not special. It should be handled exactly like any other tabs.</p><p>My real-life case is this: I have tabs within tabs within tabs (2 to 4 levels), where 'leaf' tabs are ajax-loaded. I didn't want to initialize entire 'tab tree' in advance because there are a lot of leaf tabs and each would generate an ajax call. So I figured, I could call tabs() in a lazy-fashion for lower level tabs, on beforeActivate event, i.e. just when the user clicks given tab. The problem is that first tab clicks itself without any user activity (which is obvious) but it somehow doesn't fire beforeActivate event! </p><p>Now, if I use create() event as suggested above, it means that I'm using different event to accomplish exactly the same thing (i.e. initialize sub-tabs in this tab). Which makes the first tab somehow special by design. It does not make any sense and it's completely counter-intuitive. If I use create() event just to do something for the first tab and then I change order of my tabs (some other tab becomse the "magical" first tab) then my code will stop working correctly.</p>

              <p>"It is not being activated, it is active at the time of initialization." So what you are saying is during initialization you activate the tab but you do not fire the activate event. That seems odd.</p><p>The change event for a select box is a bad analogy. One is an event that happens when something CHANGES the other is an event when something ACTIVATES. But the initially selected tab is activated and therefore should have the activate event fire. </p><p>The create event should take care of things that need to happen during creation of the entire tab widget, for instance verify something exists in the DOM, it should not to load the data for a tab that is already handled when the tab activates.

              <p>Whats the situation on this bug? The first tab is activated (auto) so would like to have an event to handle it's display as with other tabs. It's inconsistent. After the content of a tab is loaded (async) and displayed you may need to run methods against it. Not being able to on the first load is frustrating and unexpected. I'm looking for a hack solution.

              <p>I would like to support the argument that the current approach is inconsistent and problematic by describing my use case and the bug that the current approach forced me to track down.</p><p>I am using tabs with panel-content that is dynamically generated when a tab is selected; I bind to beforeActivate to generate that content.  The tab which is initially open is based on some system state which can be captured by an integer i: if the system is in state i then tab i should be the initially open one.</p><p>Since I have already bound beforeActivate the obvious way to set up the panel is to invoke tabs('option', 'active', i) to cause it to fill in the panel for tab i.</p><p>This works great, *unless* the system happens to be in state 0.  In this case, since by your current approach tab 0 is "already active", calling tabs('option', 'active', 0) does *not* trigger a beforeActivate event, so the panel is not initialized.</p><p>I could manually initialize the panel based on i when I create the tabs, but this means I am duplicating code.  If instead the beforeActivate event was triggered for whichever panel was initially selected, I would have clean code.  Instead, as a quick fix, I am calling tabs('option', 'active', i-1) followed by tabs('option', 'active', i) in order to ensure that the beforeActivation event gets triggered.  But this is clearly wasteful as it leads to the generation of an entire panel which is then discarded.</p>

              <p>OK, so how does one raise the level of this issue? Sorry, but this design is simply wrong. It is critical that event driven UI controls generate events at the right time, and are semantically relevant. CREATE and ACTIVATE are semantically different, happen logically at different times in the lifecycle of the UI, and require different responses from the application code. ACTIVATE should logically happen any time a tab is show - the "first" time is no special case, and collapsing it with CREATE is semantically incorrect. It requires every application to create a 'hack' that handles CREATE events even if that event is of no interest to the application.</p><p>This problem (of initial state and events) has been addressed many times over the years in other event-based UI systems - just take a look at the event model for Win32, Motif, Swing, SWT... similar controls (lists, tabs, etc) generate 'selected' or 'activated' events consistently, including an event that reflects initial state of the control.</p><p>Please learn something from 20 years of UI design history, this is no longer rocket science and it not even really debatable, the issue has long since been decided in favor of application simplicity and consistency.</p><p>But, I suspect adding a comment to a closed bug report is not useful... so how can the user community get this fixed??</p>

              <p>I want to add my support for a rethink on this issue too. I'm developing an application that uses the activate event to perform some checks and initialization whenever a panel is displayed. Everything works wonderfully except for the initial display of the first panel when the tabs widget is first created.</p><p>The create event is a useless alternative, because the tab widget is not fully initialized at this point -- specifically, when you call the 'option' function, all you get is "cannot call methods on slider prior to initialization." The first panel is not fully activated until much later.</p><p>Therefore the create event is simply not an acceptable alternative to an activation event for the first panel. It serves a completely different purpose, and is triggered far to early to be of any use to developers writing panel initialization code.</p><p>I have to agree with markm in his last comment. I do not understand the logic behind the current design. What possible reason is there for making the initial display of the first panel the widget a special case? It is the <strong>only</strong> time the activate event is not triggered when a panel is displayed. Worse, the current design is actually counter-intuitive, since the implication is that the first panel never goes through the activation process internally, which is patently not the case.</p>

The <code>create</code> event is triggered after the entire initialization process has completed. Even if we did fire an <code>activate</code> event during initialization, it would have to be *before* the <code>create</code> event, not after. Referencing a slider instance is also meaningless since there is absolutely no context here.</p>

              <blockquote> OK, so your recommendation is to handle both the "create" and the "activate" events. That works and I'll move my code to that paradigm. [...] Also, I'd like to reiterate that I can't see a scenario where a developer would use the activate event expecting the current behavior. Anyone handling the activate event would need to handle both.</blockquote><p>Pretty much nailed it. It's kinda disheartening for developers to come across such counter-intuitive & alienating behavior from jQueryUI because working around this sort of stuff is bound to lead to unnecessary over-engineering and code-bloat. Firing the activate event for the tab which is selected by-default upon creating the tab-control shouldn't be such a big a deal.</p><p>Wish I could understand why we are getting flogged like this for no reason other than pure stubborness which goes against virtually against any and all rules of thumb and common-sense followed by most if not all ui-toolkits out there. Sigh.</p>

              <p>It's incredible I had to find this 8 years old ticket, and no solution. I solved using a wrapper to the function I was trying to trigger on both cases:</p><pre class="wiki">
$('#tabs').tabs({
    activate: function(event, tab) { onTabRender(tab.newPanel)},
    create: function(event, tab)   { onTabRender(tab.panel)   },
});

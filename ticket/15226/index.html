For the REPRO: You can test at: https://pridesash.com/builder/ with the following steps:&#92;
&#92;
Select a sash, open the chrome inspector, and on Step 2, drag the &quot;Class of 2017&quot; box down. You will see that the original height I set in subpixel (67.35ish patchign the bug with both width and height set) will turn into 67px as set by jQuery UI. Which only happens on newest Chrome.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">I have a product builder using Draggable (https://pridesash.com/builder/#step/1) which used to work fine with UI 1.10 or under. I now suddenly find myself with a bug on newer chrome versions since using UI 1.11.4 (I think).&#92;
&#92;
When dragging a canvas element, for some reason, jQueryUI now sets a css style &#39;height&#39; on Chrome 59+ (at least) in addition to &#39;left&#39; and &#39;top&#39;. That &#39;height&#39; isn&#39;t set on Chrome 49, Safari, Firefox or Edge. Only recent Chrome versions. I assume this &#39;height&#39; might be related to a different unrelated chrome bug.&#92;
&#92;
I was relying only on the &#39;width&#39; and &#39;height&#39; attributes of the canvas for the canvas proportions. This new unnecessary introduced &#39;height&#39; messes up proportions of canvas boxes when re-editing a piece of canvas text.&#92;
&#92;
This now forces me to set css style &#39;height&#39; and &#39;width&#39; every time to prevent the &#39;height&#39; from affecting canvas proportions and either shrinking or expanding the box width. But that shouldn&#39;t be required.&#92;
&#92;
Any clue has to what this new &#39;height&#39; comes from?&#92;

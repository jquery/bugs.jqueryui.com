              <p>Yes that's what base href is used for running the page as if external resources are from a different uri.  Since isLocal makes assumptions that location.href is used for building uri requests, it fails since location.href has nothing to do with loading resources.</p><p>Replying to [comment:3 scott.gonzalez]:</p><blockquote> All that your test shows is that the base URI is different than the current page.

              <p>Yes the link is NOT LOCAL.  Changing the base href on a page makes every link NOT LOCAL.  I really don't care what the link is, I'm using inline content and this naive 'unobtrusive ajax' feature is half replacing it with remote content.  Even if the links are left BLANK, it will still continue trying to fetch content from the base href.</p><p>I want to break my content into pieces that can be shown via clicking a tab just like the description says on jQuery UI site.  Instead what I get is a widget that cannot have it's ajax features turned off, cannot recognise when content is already in a div on the page when base href has been changed, and can not have it's behavior overridden short of rewriting the proccessTabs method which even if I did would be broken in the current release and probably broken again in the next release.  </p>

"You don't understand ..." is not an insult[*], it's a statement of fact. Not a fact that you don't understand, but a fact that Scott doesn't believe you understand. Based on what you've said in the discussion, Scott believes you lack some level of understanding of the specification, the behavior of browsers or both. A gentler way to say it would be "I don't believe you understand..." or "I don't think your understanding is correct..." but we're taught in english class "don't start a sentence with 'I think' or 'I believe'; you're the one talking, if you make a statement it's reasonably understood that it's a statement of your own belief, etc. so just come out and say it"</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[*] Ok, it might be an insult if it were "You don't understand anything about web development!!

              <p>I know Tabs do what they should do. But I still want to ask what the good approach is when I meet the same situation. It is really hard to use "proper" hrefs as "http://api.jquery.com/add/" , "http://api.jquery.com/add" and "http://api.jquery.com/add?abc=123" are regarded different in isLocal() but linked to the same page. Or should I change the hrefs every time the page is loaded? Maybe it would be nice if there is an "isLocal" option.</p><p>Currently I add a line in isLocal() as workaround : </p><p>           if ($(anchor).hasClass("local")) return true;</p>

              <p>I don't see how this is non-trivial to fix. The users who are running into this problem have to be dealing with <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> day in and day out. They have to user proper URLs on every single link they create, this is no exception. They *MUST* know how to properly generate URLs to link to pages within their app, otherwise they can't create any links at all. </p><p>Here's the trivial, dynamic PHP implementation: <code>'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] . '#foo'</code>.</p><p>It's also fairly trivial to fix this in <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, but I won't provide sample code because that is the wrong place to be fixing this and should be highly discouraged. The behavior of links are clearly defined and consistent across all browsers. There is absolutely no reason people should be using incorrect URLs and then hacking around them in <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</p><p>Finally, it's important to note that "fixing" this would mean breaking the correct behavior for everyone who uses <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> properly. Keep in mind that this was fixed because people with proper URLs were running into the real bug that existed in the old code.</p>

              <p>The current implementation doesn't take into account loading tabs in something loaded with AJAX e.g. into a modal dialog. The location.href does not change then, but the REQUEST_URI does change. You would need to feed the AJAX loaded page the URL of the containing page so that the correct links (referring to the page where the modal dialog was opened) can be formed. Using REFERER for this is no good because in IE it doesn't work consistently.</p><p>Would adding a simple "forceLocal" option be that big of a deal? I don't see how making development more difficult and more inconsistent (especially since the documentation offers no help with the base tag issue) is going to help anyone. Having users move away from using base tag (and thus having to change a lot of stuff) is going to be more hassle than implementing a simple workaround.</p>

              <p>Replying to [comment:25 scott.gonzalez]:</p><blockquote> @kasakka Presumably everything you load via ajax is either broken or using absolute URLs. You've opted into using <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>, so you need to use it properly.</blockquote><p>So let's say that my BASE tag href is "http://www.example.com/", I'm currently on page "http://www.example.com/pages/index", which has a button that opens a modal dialog where content is loaded via AJAX from "http://www.example.com/pages/stuff". Inside the pages/stuff page there are two tabs, with links that have HREF "#tab1" and "#tab2".</p><p>These evaluate to "http://www.example.com/#tab1" as per the BASE tag. What jQuery UI expects is "http://www.example.com/pages/index/#tab1" aka location.href + tab ID. I could make this work by manually changing pages/stuff's links' HREFs to "pages/index/#tab1" etc, but this would make the pages/stuff page unusable everywhere else but on pages/index. Should I want to load for example a control panel via AJAX on any page, those links would have to be changed to reflect that containing page.</p><p>The links are all relative to the base tag, but the AJAX loaded content when processed with PHP would have to know the URL of the containing page. With earlier jQ UI versions this was not necessary as it expected that simple href="#tab1" referred to a local tab so nothing broke.</p><p>And this is why there should be a "forceLocal" option. Correct me if I'm doing something completely wrong.</p>

              <p>With many PHP frameworks, using base always as the root (as in my example) instead of the current page url saves a huge amount of aggravation with pretty much any url the framework generates.

              <p>I just have stumpled on this issue and have read the comments.</p><p>In my opinion, if jQuery UI deals with &lt;div/&gt; as anchor replacement you cannot say "we doing everything right, use base properly" because accessing a &lt;div/&gt; is not the common way a browser would handle this fragment.</p><p>A developer is expecting that when jQuery UI can handle with &lt;div/&gt; the script is checking that a id exists rather then just checking the href.</p><p>So if you give the feature a, you must also implement feature b.</p>

              <p>I debugged 3 days after changing 1.8.3 to 1.10 en jquery to 1.9 and did finally find out that this is the problem, my use of the basetag. But it seems to be it for over 15 months now in the community. This is unbelievable and seen the discussion it looks that it will not be fixed in the next 15 months. If I must rewrite my framework to not use the basetag, it takes lots and lots of work. That is not an option. The only option is to hack the code or stop with jquery ui. This was more debugging time than writing a small tab set by myself.</p><p>I hate hacking, than i can't use the google cdn anymore. Could you please add an workaround? The isLocal class is workable for me.</p>

It's just that, the *base* of all URLs on the given page. And that's all, there's nothing else special about it.</p><p>if you can resolve <a href="http://www.angrydev.com/pages/#tab-1" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://www.angrydev.com/pages/#tab-1</a> as being local to <a href="http://www.angrydev.com/pages/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://www.angrydev.com/pages/</a></p><p>There is No reason you shouldn't be able to resolve /#tab-1 as being local to / (with a base href of "http://www.angrydev.com/pages/")</p><p>it's the same damn situation. But you're refusing to support it just because it's using a Base HREF. and that is just not even sad, it's ridiculous.</p><p>You had no problem doing it up until 1.9.0. So why the hell can't you do it now? Especially when so many have shown it's needed, and so many have given you the code to do it? </p>

What the users actually want is a way to tell Tabs: "treat the href value as an ID, even if it looks like a URL".

It's just telling Tabs how you'd like it to behave on a specific page.</li></ul><p>Given that, this should not be a bug report, but should be a feature request for a "treatAs" option with the values: "auto", "remote", "local", with "auto" being the default and having the current behavior.</p>

              <p>This took me a long time to figure out too. Let me explain, as I think the devs and users are ALL correct, in different ways. </p><p>UI-DEVS: "This links to the content AS INTENDED. 'nuff said."</p><p>UI-USERS: "This does not link to the div. Problem."</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: I think the problem is that the UI devs see the anchor tags as linking to both on-page and off-page content. A feature since it can load all kinds of things. The users however can't figure out why the href, which LOOKS like like a jQuery selector, isn't going to the div the selector of the anchor points too.  Seems like the dual use of in-page links coming from both 'name' and 'id' attributes is what is screwing this up. That, and not even realizing that tabs can grab remote content.</p><p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong>: I think merely changing the example code to demonstrate: a local div, a div using remote content and a fully qualified URL to a local div with a bit of text mentioning the base URL issue. For instance, I didn't even realize until this issue appeared, that I can load remote content in a tab.</p><p>Comments?</p>

It would be more helpful if one of the tabs on the 1st page demonstrated this loading of off-page content. It's not a bug at all. I realize that. It's a misunderstanding of how it works. That's what's tripping people like me up. </p><blockquote> And the problem is that most people using <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> don't want to take the time to write the correct URL.

For me, I thought it only loaded content on-page and the href of the tab was a link to an id of the div that was selected by the tab (and why I thought it was odd that you all did it this way... which you didn't I now know). I didn't know it had anything to do with a URL at all, even though it was an href. This was a misunderstanding on my part, because the href in the example code looked like a selector. But, I think if a single example in the front page demonstrated this, it would have saved me about 45 minutes. </p><p>Cheers and keep up the good work.</p>

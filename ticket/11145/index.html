&#92;
IMO keypress to select while inside a contenteditable isn&#39;t a big deal if your selection is lost. Not many users would do that in a rich editor use case. Maintaining the selection is necessary to apply commands to a range inside a contendeditable div. To resolve this ticket at the expense of keypress to select while inside a contenteditable only the focus call has to changed to only fire in IE. The focus call doesn&#39;t seem to effect FF/Chrome so it could also be changed to be ignored by Safari and called by all the rest.&#92;
&#92;
I doubt you can use feature detection as this is obviously a bug/nuance in Safari since all the other browsers respond differently. Do you have a policy on how situations such as this are resolved?

This is exactly what I've been saying over and over.</p><p>Focus has to be set to the button in order for anything to work. Clicking the button is causing the focus to move and the selection to clear. We're restoring the selection, which is then killing the focus on the button in some browsers. So we then have to fix the focus, which is now stupidly killing the selection in Safari. It's become a vicious cycle. Preventing the default behavior of mousedown prevents focus from moving, which caused a regression. No matter how many times you ask us to just not set focus, that will not be an acceptable solution.</p>

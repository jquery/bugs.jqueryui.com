    <h5 class="ticket-description-title">Description</h5>
    <div class="ticket-description"><p>We built a number of jQuery widgets under 1.8.  Many of these widgets had options that were arrays:</p><p>options : </p><p>   myArrayOption : [1, 2, 3]</p><p>and this worked well.  Not so under 1.9.  Under 1.9, when the widget is instantiated, instead of making a copy of the array option, it makes a copy of the reference to the array.  So, if you instantiate the widget multiple times, they all reference the same array and changing one changes them all.  It appears the problem is caused because 1.9.0 uses the new $.widget.extend() instead of the regular jquery.extend()  The $.widget form does not handle arrays properly.</p><p>The fix is simple, in $.widget.extend() change:</p><p>target[ key ] = $.isPlainObject( value ) ? $.widget.extend( {}, target[ key ], value ) : value;</p><p>to:</p><p>            if ($.isArray(value)) {</p><p>               target[key] = $.widget.extend([], target[ key ], value);  </p><p>            }</p><p>            else {</p><p>               target[ key ] = $.isPlainObject( value ) ? $.widget.extend( {}, target[ key ], value ) : value;</p><p>            }</p><p>I have worked around it by simply overriding $.widget.extend, which also requires changing the first line from slice.call(...) to Array.prototype.slice.call(...)</p><p>I'm going to let someone else change make the change to the repository...</p></div>

              <p>This is intentional. It's impossible to keep a reference if we do a copy, but it's easy for you to copy if that's what you want. The old behavior was very problematic.</p>

              <p>OK, but in <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> an array is essentially just an object where you use indices to reference elements instead of names.  Why wouldn't you want the behavior to be the same for arrays and objects?  You copy objects, but not arrays.  </p><p>Perhaps there is some place in the framework where this causes trouble that I don't know about but I definitely don't see why when you instantiate widgets of the same type with an option that is an array that you would want all those widgets to reference the same array.  Sure, I can create a routine that does a copy, but that means two steps for instantiation, and means all existing code has to be changed to the two step instantiation process.</p>

              <p>Personally, I agree with the original poster. It seems somewhat odd that the behavior would be different between the two. Although, I slightly disagree with the poster in that I think this behavior doesn't make sense at all and it should always be pass by reference for all options. It was painful for me to learn that it wasn't this way, since it makes the most sense to me.</p><p>Can someone comment on why cloning happens in the first place and also on why it makes more sense to have different behavior based on argument type than being consistent?</p><p>I think it makes the most sense to always pass by reference regardless of the argument type, because, as Scott points out, it is easy to copy if that's what you want, but much more painful to keep references if it is copied by default.</p>

              <p>OK, so basically you are saying that default values should be set in create, rather than in the options declaration?  That should work, but certainly makes it less clean unless you set all the options in create.</p><p>My biggest problem is that there was a rather fundamental change made to a rather established and stable API that addresses limited use cases and that breaks existing software in a rather significant way that is not always readily apparent (i.e. it doesn't just create a javascript error).  Browser based developers have enough troubles keeping up with subtle browser changes.  Hell, much of the reason for using an API like jQuery is that it hides these browser differences and changes and let's us program against a consistent API.  But this change shows that maybe the goal of jQuery isn't to be consistent; that I have to worry about some subtle break every time I upgrade jQuery.</p>

&gt; &gt; Why create a custom event when a native one exists for that exact action? Doesn&#39;t make any sense.&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; See the discussion in #8878.&#92;
&#92;
For custom functionality like draggable that makes perfect sense, but as another reply in that thread stated creating a custom event to replace a native event is not intuitive in the slightest. All my code is bound to native events, the previous version of selectmenu worked with native events, now to use this version I have to find them all and change them to your version of the event.&#92;
&#92;
Isn&#39;t the purpose to jQuery to reduce complexity? This change is the opposite of that. I fail to see what improvement using &quot;selectmenuchange&quot; provides over &quot;change&quot;. It&#39;s more confusing and for what benefit?&#92;
&#92;
Consider the case where you want to bind an event to &quot;change&quot; on every input in a form. Consider your own documentation on the change event: http://api.jquery.com/change/&#92;
&#92;
Your example code won&#39;t work with your plugin. It will fail silently as change is never triggered on the select. This is the exact situation I&#39;m in. I have a form, any time a field is modified I need to trigger a function. Originally I could bind it at once;&#92;
&#92;
$( form ).find( &#39;input, select&#39; ).on( &#39;change&#39;, function( ) { } );&#92;
&#92;
Now I have to write it as two lines;&#92;
&#92;
$( form ).find( &#39;input&#39; ).on( &#39;change&#39;, function( ) { } );&#92;
$( form ).find( &#39;select&#39; ).on( &#39;selectmenuchange&#39;, function( ) { } );&#92;
&#92;
And what if all the selects aren&#39;t using selectmenu? In that case I&#39;d have to bind it 3 times... see where I&#39;m going with this and why it&#39;s a bad idea?</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1405511515665419</span>

Originally I could bind it at once;</p><p>$( form ).find( 'input, select' ).on( 'change', function( ) { } );</p><p>Now I have to write it as two lines;</p><p>$( form ).find( 'input' ).on( 'change', function( ) { } );</p><p>$( form ).find( 'select' ).on( 'selectmenuchange', function( ) { } );</p><p>And what if all the selects aren't using selectmenu? In that case I'd have to bind it 3 times... see where I'm going with this and why it's a bad idea?</p>

&gt; We cannot guarantee the expected behavior of the native `change` event because complex widgets may have native controls focus and blur at various points during what is considered a single interaction. Therefore, the only reliable event is a custom one.&#92;
&#92;
Is this actually the case for this plugin? If yes, what code prevents you from using the original event, and will you accept a patch to fix it? The original plugin did not have this flaw so a custom event cannot be necessary.&#92;
&#92;
&gt; As for having to make everything so complex with event bindings, you&#39;re fooling yourself. If you were going to do all three bindings, you could just do:&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; {{{&#92;
&gt; $( form ).find( &quot;input, select&quot; ).on( &quot;change selectmenuchange&quot;, function() { ... } );&#92;
&gt; }}}&#92;
&#92;
I could do that yes but why am I binding events on elements that will never fire..? Easy != correct.&#92;
&#92;
&gt; Or you could get more sophisticated if you want to guard against potentially incorrect native `change` events on custom widgets (and while you&#39;re at it, avoid the cost of direct bindings):&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; {{{&#92;
&gt; $( form ).on( &quot;change selectmenuchange&quot;, &quot;input, select&quot;, function( event ) {&#92;
&gt;     if ( $( event.target ).selectmenu( &quot;instance&quot; ) &amp;&amp; event.type === &quot;change&quot; ) {&#92;
&gt;         return;&#92;
&gt;     }&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt;     // Handle all real changes&#92;
&gt; });&#92;
&gt; }}}&#92;
&gt; &#92;

&gt;     $( this ).trigger( &quot;change&quot; );&#92;
&gt; });&#92;
&gt; }}}&#92;
&#92;
Doesn&#39;t that seem a bit convoluted for something that could be easily solved by simply triggering the native event? It seems this is being implemented &quot;just because&quot; and the solution is not intuitive which is the entire point of using a library like jQuery.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1405519841993369</span>

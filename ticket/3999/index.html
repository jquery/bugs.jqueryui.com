              <p>I would really like to see this feature added, too.  I might have to switch to a different calendar that supports this.</p><p>I've seen some discussion that this feature isn't needed because the user can just clear the field - NOT TRUE.  On most of the sites I've worked on that use a date picker the field is READ ONLY.  Often times the server expects the date in a certain format so the user isn't allowed to just type in whatever they want - instead they are forced to use the date picker.   So we need a clear option please. :-)</p>

              <p>Use case: the input field is read-only.  We had to do this because validating users' typed date input became a headache in legacy code.  Using the calendar, triggered by clicking on either the input or an icon button, solved the issue in a matter of minutes.  However, users want the ability to clear the date field via the pop-up.  The alternative is to add a "clear" button next to the calendar's icon button.</p>

Most compelling to me is that if you use the altField option, the argument that you can clear the text-field with the keyboard does not apply; if altField is supported, there should be a method of clearing that field. Other related scenarios are when the calendar widget is compulsory - i.e. the input field is a read-only display, so that the user cannot enter invalid values.</p>

&gt; here is my solution, you can use done button as clear with the following hack&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; $(&quot;.datepicker&quot;).datepicker({&#92;
&gt;     showButtonPanel: true,&#92;
&gt;     closeText: &#39;Clear&#39;,&#92;
&gt; });&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; $.datepicker._generateHTML_Old = $.datepicker._generateHTML;&#92;
&gt; $.datepicker._generateHTML = function(inst) {&#92;
&gt;     res = this._generateHTML_Old(inst);&#92;
&gt;     res = res.replace(&quot;_hideDatepicker()&quot;,&quot;_clearDate(&#39;#&quot;+inst.id+&quot;&#39;)&quot;);&#92;
&gt;     return res;&#92;
&gt; }&#92;
&#92;
Here&#39;s a slightly less intrusive version of this hack, which actually adds a seperate clear button. Although it&#39;s not configurable in the options; you could of course extend a new datepicker and add the override to that instead, if needs be. Note that I too am suffering from the read-only use case.&#92;
&#92;
$(function(){&#92;
	//wrap up the redraw function with our new shiz&#92;
	var dpFunc = $.datepicker._generateHTML; //record the original&#92;
	$.datepicker._generateHTML = function(inst){&#92;
		var thishtml = $( dpFunc.call($.datepicker, inst) ); //call the original&#92;

&gt; &quot;seems like overkill since a user can simply clear out the field value manually. Plus, clearing the input would make the input invalid if the field is required. It’s best to encourage users to pick a date, not clear the field.&quot; &#92;
&gt;  It is the reasonable thought behind the removing of the clear button.&#92;

&gt; Not all  fields are required. Asuming an empty field might be invalid is wrong!&#92;

&gt; &quot;a user can simply clear out the field value manually&quot; &#92;
&gt;  It is not a good usable choice, while a user clears out the input, the calendar can be an obstruction,  the input sometimes might be covered by the calendar.&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; Most of us use the calendar to avoid wrong format type and it is very important don&#39;t let the user think about the right date format we want (and to write it)&#92;

&gt; &#39;&#39;&#39; The best is to encourage users to not use the date input field manually at all. So, since they can choose a date by touch or by click,  they shoud be able to clear the date by touch and by click too.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#92;
&gt; &#92;
&gt; It is better to let the developers choose what is invalid field or not :)&#92;

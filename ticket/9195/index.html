              <p>My use case is that I want to render HTML, like per the example.

.data( "ui-autocomplete" )._renderItem(..)

              <p>Just another note, the .data("ui-autocomplete"), which is used by the demo, was .data("autocomplete") for earlier versions of jquery, so this looks like something that can be changed without warning. That is it is not a stable public API that should be used the way the demo is using it.</p><p>I think perhaps the demo code should class a new widget inherited from ui.autocomplete that overrides _renderItem in a clear fashion without resorting to using .data.</p><p>Would you be willing to accept a new version of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data</a> that does this?</p>

              <p>TJ covered the important parts, but I want to add a few notes:</p><p>You're explanation of why the following fails is completely wrong:</p><p>```</p><p>$("&lt;input ...&gt;")</p><p>.autocomplete({...})</p><p>.data( "ui-autocomplete" )._renderItem(..)</p><p>.appendTo(form)</p><p>```</p><p>The instance is definitely stored in data at that point. You shouldn't be invoking <code>_renderItem()</code> here, you should be overriding it. You can't chain <code>.appendTo()</code> like that because you're moved to the instance.</p><p>If you'd like to be able to set <code>renderItem</code> as an option, write an extension. It'll be less than 10 lines, and will blissfully allow you to do completely incorrect things without noticing at first.</p><p>For example, your implementation is htmlautocomplete is incorrect. Supporting HTML is *NOT* as simple as just changing the rendering. You also need to change the search logic because you don't want to match on HTML.</p>

So rather then trying to work together on the issue, I get defensive.</p><p>If there are any problems in the way I am using autocomplete, it is because the demo is broken, because I have copied the same techniques used in the demo.

Without a live test case it's impossible for us to provide any help. Please stop repeating your arguments when there is clear evidence to the contrary. Provide a reduced test case that shows an actual problem or we will just continue to repeat ourselves (actually, we'll just stop replying).</p><blockquote> The demo does not change the search logic, so if that it true, then the demo is broken.</blockquote><p>No, the demo doesn't claim to be implementing an HTML label. The label is the actual content, with no markup. The rendering is custom, but expects the label from the data source to be plain text, so searching works exactly as expected. I was pointing out that if you're trying to treat the label as containing markup, then you're breaking the built-in search functionality.</p>

              <p>I just noticed, this discussion seems to have wondered somewhat off-topic. Mistakes made in my examples didn't help (trying to do too many things at once). So will try to get back on topic.</p><p>In comment:1 I was told "We don't document methods that are intended for private use by the widgets" which implies that the demo should not be using a method that is intended for private use by the widgets. Then in comment:2 I am told "_renderItem() is public API, it's just not part of the API exposed via the standard interface." which seems to conflict with the first statement. Is it public/private or what? If it is part of the public API, why is it not documented in the standard API documentation?</p><p>As such I find these sorts of statements ... confusing.

Maybe nothing that can be done about this now, hopefully the new method will remain stable.

The custom data demo is a one-off. There's one place where we're using a custom data source with custom rendering. The categories demo is a good example of a generic application in which a new widget is created.</p><p>The bottom line is this ticket is about use of an "undocumented hack".
